// This class is used as a handle to trigger animations when

// be used within components as a styling hook.

// No styles are applied by the objects themselves. This file is only here
// for the sake of documentation.

    // This class gets applied to the `.obj-unviler` element
    // as soon as unveiler is initialized. This can be used
    // to scope elements to apply animations in a safe way.
    // If this class is applied, you know the JS can run
    // to unveil it. Without it, you might end up with invisible
    // content if something goes wrong with the JS.
    //
    // This wrapper isn't as important to use if an element
    // isn't invisible to begin with.
