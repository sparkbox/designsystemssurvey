**More than 60% of respondents classified their design system as successful.**

Of the 86 respondents with a design system at their organization, about 64% said their design system was either “successful” or “very successful”; 29% felt their design system was either “average” or “not very successful”; and 7% preferred not to say.

**Successful design systems are robust.**

Design systems that were categorized as “successful” or “very successful” tended to include more elements—e.g. color systems, HTML code, typography, and voice and tone guidelines—than those that were categorized as less successful. “Successful” or “very successful” design systems had between six and 19 elements, with a median of 14 elements, while “average” or “unsuccessful” design systems were reported to have between two and 18 elements, with a median of 11.
