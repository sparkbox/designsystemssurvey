Design systems are thought to increase consistency and efficiency, and lead to gains in accessibility and team onboarding.

For our respondents, strong motivations to build a design system included the desire to increase user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) consistency, design and development efficiency, and code reusability. Another somewhat motivating factor was brand consistency.

When asked if there were other reasons for pursuing a design system, three mentioned web accessibility, and two noted that design systems reduce dependence on tribal knowledge, making it easier to onboard and educate new team members and vendors.
