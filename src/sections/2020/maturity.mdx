<SectionHeader title="Design System Maturity" name="maturity">

In our [first survey back in 2018](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2018/), design systems were relatively new and unproven. In our [2019 survey](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2019/), we noticed that everyone’s design systems were growing up. This year, we decided to ask about design systems that had lasting power to see if there were any lessons we could learn from them.

  <h2>What Makes a Design System Mature?</h2>
  <p>In-house respondents were given a list of 15 factors and were asked on a scale of 1 to 5 if they were significant factors in contributing to a design system’s maturity.</p>

  <p>Additional factors included: Design system is used by most or all of the organization’s applications/websites (3.98); Has support at the executive level (3.9); Is versioned (3.75); Governance practices are instituted (3.73); Usability testing (3.7); Accessibility testing (3.68); Has a roadmap (3.66); Automated testing (3.41); Analytics to measure adoption (3.14); and Quality metrics for component versions (component scorecards) (2.99).</p>
  <h2>What do these factors say about maturity?</h2>
  <p>Notably, the top three maturity factors indicate that the design system has become part of their team’s workflow and is well-supported by the organization’s user groups:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The design system is part of the design and development culture</li>
    <li>The design system has support at the individual contributor level</li>
    <li>The design system has a high rate of adoption by groups within the organization</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The fourth and fifth factors suggest that the design system has been incorporated into the technical architecture and processes of the organization:</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>The design system is used by all newer builds and all future builds</li>
    <li>The design system is included in the development pipeline</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Growing a Design System</h2>
  <p>When asked in an open-ended question why they gave themselves this maturity level, 27 of 30 respondents with an immature design system answered that they were still working on building their design system.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“We’re just getting started, and the culture of the organization is very siloed.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“There’s still so much to be done in order to fully utilize the system across the entire ecosystem.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“We haven't moved into code as the ‘source of truth’ for components.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr />
  <p>Of those with a mature design system, 9 of the 13 respondents said they ranked their design system higher because it solved their problems. In addition, 8 of the 13 respondents said their design system is still continuing to grow.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Our design system is still evolving, but it does provide solutions for nearly all relevant use cases.”</p>
  </blockquote>
