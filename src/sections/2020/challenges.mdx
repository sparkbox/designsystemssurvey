<SectionHeader title="Design System Challenges" name="challenges">

In the [2018 survey](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2018/#why-design-systems-need-champions), we found that starting a design system required an executive champion and cross-departmental buy-in. In the [2019 survey](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2019/#section-3), we found that adoption and maintenance were common challenges. This section explores challenges uncovered in this year’s survey.

<div class="obj-max-width util-pad-vertical-lg util-pad-vertical-h1@md util-pad-vertical-h2@lg">

## This year, respondents shared challenges that span throughout the life of a design system. Three challenges stood out:

<div class="util-font-size-lg">
  <ol>
    <li>Planning a design system that is built to last</li>
    <li>Managing changes to the design system</li>
    <li>Encouraging organizational adoption </li>
  </ol>
</div>

## Planning a Design System That Is Built to Last

<div class="cmp-aside cmp-aside--float cmp-fade-right js-watch" data-animate="cmp-fade-right--animate">
  <p class="cmp-aside__text cmp-aside__text--callout">In-house and agency respondents frequently mentioned needing a better plan and a more well-thought-out strategy.</p>
</div>

In-house respondents were asked this open-ended question: if you had the ability to go back in time, what would you do differently with your design system? The most common in-house response mentioned having a better plan and a more well-thought-out strategy (18 out of 42 responses).

When agency respondents were asked why a client’s design system failed, they commonly reported the lack of a well-thought-out strategy (5 of 16 respondents).

### Is your design system creating technical debt?

In addition, 42% of in-house respondents felt that the way their design system was originally built created debt for the organization’s technical or design departments.

When we asked how building the design system created debt, the two top responses were both related to a planning failure:

1. Lack of planning (9 of 23 respondents)
2. Failure to understand the magnitude of a design system (8 of 23 respondents)

### Takeaway: Planning supports success

If hindsight is truly 20/20, planning and developing a clear strategy early in a design system’s life could contribute to its long-term success.

## Managing Changes to the Design System
  
### What teams have maintenance processes?

In general, 63% of in-house respondents have a process for maintaining outdated, unused, or faulty components in their design systems. The age of the system impacted the likelihood to report having a meintenance process:

- Only 44% of respondents with a design system less than one year old have a maintenance process.
- 77% of respondents with design systems that have existed for one year or longer, the percentage with a maintenance process grows to 77%.

The likelihood of having a process was also higher for those in-house respondents who called their systems successful.

### Does your organization have a process for maintaining design system components?

The likelihood of having a process was also higher for those in-house respondents who called their systems successful. Of the respondents who reported their design systems to be successful or very successful, 81% had a maintenance process. And that same group of respondents also viewed their change approval process as successful.

Of the in-house respondents who reported their design systems to be not successful or not very successful, only 46% had a maintenance process. Within this percentage, 55% of respondents perceived their maintenance process as unsuccessful.

## Encouraging Organizational Adoption

Since our first survey, respondents have reported adoption as a challenge, and that theme has continued this year.

<div class="cmp-aside cmp-aside--float cmp-fade-right js-watch" data-animate="cmp-fade-right--animate">
  <p class="cmp-aside__text cmp-aside__text--callout">In-house and agency respondents listed adoption as the top challenge faced in building, using, or maintaining design systems.</p>
</div>

In-house respondents were asked an open-ended question about the biggest challenges they have faced in building, using, or maintaining their system. Adoption was the top answer, with 21 of 56 respondents mentioning it. When agency respondents were asked a similar question, the top reason was also adoption, with 8 of the 25 respondents mentioning it.

Respondents also highlighted the impact adoption has on a design system’s success.

When in-house respondents were asked from a list of six options for the primary reason their design system is not successful, 52% of respondents said adoption difficulties, placing it second (just behind staffing difficulties).

Perhaps recognizing the importance of adoption, just under half of the in-house respondents said that improving design system adoption is a top priority for this upcoming year.
