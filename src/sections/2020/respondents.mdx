<SectionHeader title="The Respondents" name="respondents">

[Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com), a web design and development firm, directed this survey for the third year in a row (check out the [2018](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2018) and [2019](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2019/) results if you missed them). This year, the survey received 269 responses.

## The respondents were comprised of two groups:

<div class="util-font-size-lg">

- In-house respondents who work on a design system for their organization
- Agency respondents who consult with organizations on design systems

</div>

The two respondent types were asked different sets of questions with many overlapping topics. This allowed us to best understand their viewpoints on design systems. Each audience’s expertise brings value to the survey, so we will be acknowledging both types of responses.

This survey was shared across social media, in Slack channels, at web events attended by our team, at [Sparkbox’s UnConference](http://eepurl.com/g2FbOT), with visitors on [The Foundry](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry), and was emailed directly to web professionals.
