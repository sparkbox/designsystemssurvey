      <p class="cmp-type-heading-4">We were also curious about what established processes and practices were in place for our respondent’s design systems. We found that 61% of respondents had processes for subscribers to contribute to the design system. Just 44% had governance models or shared the product roadmap for the design system. And only 16% tracked metrics&mdash;which is consistent with last year’s survey results.</p>
