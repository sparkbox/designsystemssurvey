  <Quote source="Design System Subscriber">There are a lot of repeating design patterns that are not documented, as well as plenty of one-off patterns that are not documented too. It IS hard to decide whether to use an existing pattern or not because the system lacks a documented thought process behind higher level patterns and templates.</Quote>
