    <p>The most frequent approach to contribution reported by our maintainer respondents (at 57%) is to have subscribers submit feature requests and bug reports. But 36% of respondents said their design system lacks a defined process for accepting contributions and 4% said they donâ€™t accept contributions at all.</p>

    <p>When starting the system, we focused on
      contributions as actively helping to build patterns for
      teams to leverage. It helped designers onboard into

      the system.</p>
