Having a design system is an investment in being consistent that pays off with efficiency gains.

As we reflect on the results of the year’s survey, we feel the experiences of in-house teams and agencies shared a common theme: the greatest values of design systems are consistency and efficiency. These two benefits are related. Consistency is not just good for user experience or for design cohesiveness across a brand or brands, but it begets efficiency because there is no need to reinvent the wheel—either in concept or code.

Efficiency suggests speed, and speed can result in time and cost savings. This is the ultimate return on investment for an organization that adopts a design system—freeing up designers and developers to do more innovative work and freeing up budget to pursue organizational growth, product innovations, or other goals.
