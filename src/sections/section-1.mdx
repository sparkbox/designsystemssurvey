## The Respondents

This survey had 256 responses comprised of two respondent types:

1. In-house teams who use a design system for their organization
2. Agencies who build or contribute to design systems for clients

The two respondent types were asked different sets of questions with some common questions. As each audience brings different expertise to the survey, we will be acknowledging both types of responses.

This survey was shared across social media, Slack channels, at conferences attended by Sparkbox, and was emailed directly to web design and development professionals.
