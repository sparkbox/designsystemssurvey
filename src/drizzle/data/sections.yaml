# name: The title of the section

# sectionTitleHtml : Like `name`, but include &nbsp; characters to prevent
#                    awkward line breaks. Used for section-intro-boxes.
#                    If not defined, `name` will be used.

# id: Used as an id attribute so we can link to
#     fragments on the page. This should match up
#     with the name of the "content-sections" partial
#     to include for this section.
